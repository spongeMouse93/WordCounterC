This simple C project acts as a word counter, but not like your Microsoft Word standard word counter.

Certain numbers and punctuation characters will act as delimiters separating words. For example, Super23Foo contains 2 words: Super and Foo, since 23 acts as a delimiter. Case sensitivity is also preserved, so, for example, "bar" and "Bar" count as two different words. 

The point of this project is to get used to the POSIX standard C functions rather than simply the standard C functions for input and output.
